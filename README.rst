==========

smc-python has officially been released by Forcepoint and can be found at: https://github.com/forcepoint/fp-ngfw-smc-python

Python based library to provide the ability to interact with the
Stonesoft Management Center API. Provides automation capabilities for
any environment that interact with the SMC remotely.

Some of the functionality you get with the SMC Python API:

-  Create any engine types; single firewall, cluster firewalls, ips
   engines, layer 2 firewalls, master engine and virtual engines.
-  Engine operations such as enabling/disabling AV, GTI, default NAT,
   Contact Addresses, etc
-  Interface configurations
-  Routing configurations (OSPF, BGP, Static, Antispoofing)
-  Engine level commands such as rebooting, going offline, policy push,
   enable/disable SSH, etc.
-  Create and modify all network element objects such as Host, Network,
   Address Ranges, Domain Names, etc.
-  Policy control (create rules, delete rules) for layer 3 firewall
   policies
-  VPN Policy control and creation
-  Management / Log Server settings configuration
-  Admin User creation and modification
-  System level controls; update system packages, update engines, global
   blacklisting, etc
-  Tasks
-  Search operations for any object type by name, href and by filter
-  Collections interface to view all objects by type

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7

Python 3.5, 3.6

Requests >= 2.12.0

Security Management Center version 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.2, 6.2.1, 6.3.x

Getting Started
---------------

Installing package

Use pip to get latest released version:

``pip install smc-python``

Specific version:

``pip install smc-python>=0.5.8``

From git:

``pip install git+https://github.com/gabstopper/smc-python.git``

Or download the latest tarball:
`smc-python <https://github.com/gabstopper/smc-python/archive/master.zip>`__,
unzip and run:

``python setup.py install``

Branches
--------

As of version 0.6.2, the master branch will be the released version code base. This version will also have a corresponding package on
pypi. 
The develop branch is used for ongoing updates and will be merged into the master branch at release time.

If installing the develop branch, use the following:

``pip install git+https://github.com/gabstopper/smc-python.git@develop``

Testing
-------

Included are a variety of test example scripts that leverage the API to
do various tasks in /examples

Basics
------

Before any commands are run, you must obtain a login session. Once
commands are complete, call `session.logout()` to remove the active session.
To obtain the api\_key, log in to the Stonesoft Management Center and
create an API client with the proper privileges.

.. code:: python

    from smc import session

    session.login(url='http://1.1.1.1:8082', api_key='xxxxxxxxxxxxx')
    ....do stuff....
    session.logout()

Or log in to a specific Admin Domain and use a specific version of the
API:

.. code:: python

    session.login(url='http://1.1.1.1:8082', api_key='xxxxxxxxxxxxx',
                  domain=mydomain, api_version=6.2)
    ....do stuff....
    session.logout()

Once a valid session is obtained, it will be re-used for each operation
for the duration of the sessions validity, or until the program is
exited.

Extensions
**********

Extensions are available to smc-python that provide additional functionality besides what
is provided in the base library. Extensions are kept separate as they may require additional
package requirements and simplify packaging.

Extensions will require smc-python to function, but it is possible to install an extension
directly and it will grab the required smc-python version automatically.

Available extensions:

* `smc-python-monitoring <https://badge.fury.io/py/smc-python-monitoring>`__: Monitoring for SMC connections, blacklists, users, VPNs, alerts, etc. In addition this package provides the ability to 'subscribe' to administrative event modifications.


Example install of an smc-python extension:

``pip install smc-python-monitoring``

Extensions are found in the base smc-python repository as namespace packages and each is housed in it's own sub-directory of this base package.

Please see the read-the-docs documentation above for a full explanation
and technical reference on available API classes.
